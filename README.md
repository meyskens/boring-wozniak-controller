# Steve Wozniak is not boring
This doesn't [happen in Docker anymore](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/04f5c75239cba156db70523bcd90657e5c7b5ddb) but why is Kuberntetes still allowed to spread these lies???

In this repo you can find manifests for a web server called boring-wozniak. Your controller has to change these names in the cluster to the truth where Steve Wozniak is not boring.
Both the name and labels have to be changed, other parts of the spec can remain the same.~

## Backgound
This is a coding challenge to write your first Kubernetes controller for an internal Infra session at source{d}.
The idea is inspired by the famous Docker easter egg.
